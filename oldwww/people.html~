<P>
<DD>Joe Kuchta begins his fourth career (third at MIT) as he takes the reins of
the MIT golf program this year. Joe succeeds his long time friend Jack Barry as 
golf coach. Jack spent 24 years at the helm of the program.
<DD>A native of Pennsylvania, Joe enrolled in the Navy out of high school. He
spent 10 years in the service, a good portion of which was in the medical corps
in the South Pacific during World War II. He attended Tufts University after his
honorable discharge in 1948.
<DD>Following his graduation from Tufts in 1952, Joe was employed by MIT in the
research department working on fuel elements for atomic submarines. His medical
training led his supervisors to rely on him for first aid and safety concerns as
the research progressed. He served many MIT departments and satellite facilities
in a safety consulting capacity. He moved into the MIT Safety Office full-time in
the early 1960's.
<DD>Joe retired from the Safety Office in 1986. To prepare for his "retirement",
he took golf lessons from Jack Barry. Jack asked Joe if he would assist with the
intercollegiate golf program and he has been the assistant coach for the last
nine years. <I>[Taken from MIT Sports Annual 1996-97]</I>

<DD>"I've played golf since I was 7, but I've been really playing since 11.  I
made it to the state tournament my junior year in high school with an 82, and
then I shot badly at states.  I will probably work to an M. Eng. in EECS, I'm
not too sure about this yet.  Hopefully I'll get in a career I like and settle 
down with a family.  Perhaps in the future I would like to go back to school 
and get an MBA and go into business."

<P> 
<DD>   After a seven year break from golf I took it up again in the summer of 98.  This past fall I tried out for and made the varsity golf team.  Playing golf during the fall and spring helps to keep me out of trouble.  I am currently very interested in high tech start-up companies and hope to one day start my own.  I have also become involved in the entrepreneurial community at MIT after taking the entrepreneurship courses  offered by Sloan during the 1999 IAP.
